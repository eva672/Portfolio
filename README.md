# Eva Manuska — Portfolio (Next.js + Tailwind)


This is a starter portfolio site generated for Eva Manuska. It's a minimal, professional layout you can expand.


## Setup


1. Install dependencies


```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```


2. Run dev


```bash
npm run dev
```


3. Build


```bash
npm run build
npm start
```


## Deployment


Recommended: deploy to Vercel (connect your GitHub repo and push). It will auto-deploy.


## How this helps GitHub contributions


- Keep projects and blog posts inside a GitHub repo and update them frequently.
- Each commit, PR, or merged change will add to your contribution graph.
- Create a `content` folder for blog posts and push a new post weekly.


## Customize


- Replace placeholder texts and email.
- Add your avatar to `public/avatar-placeholder.png`.
- Add real repo links in `pages/projects.js`.


```

# NOTES & NEXT STEPS


1. Replace `eva@example.com` with your real contact.
2. Add your avatar image to `/public`.
3. Replace project repo links with actual GitHub URLs.
4. Consider adding a GitHub Actions workflow that updates a small stats README daily if you want extra contribution events (use responsibly).
